Extraction of causal interaction from pathway databases

## Introduction
causal-extractor is a JAVA framework developed to extract causal molecular interactions from the Reactome database. Based on defined biological templates, biological processes depicted in Reactome are translated into causal statements. The causal statements extracted follow the [MI2CAST guidelines](https://github.com/MI2CAST/MI2CAST). The output format is a PSI-MITAB 2.8.

## Notes

### Complexes
Reactome complexes can either have Complex portal ID, in which case, the complex portal ID is provided, or their own identifiers, in which case the complexes are expanded in the PSI-MI TAB2.8. The interaction identifier of the complex expansions binary interactions corresponds to the reactome ID.
